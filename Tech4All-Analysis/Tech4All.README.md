# Portfolio Project - AceProducts eCommerce Analysis
Tech4All, Inc. is a global SaaS company offering solutions to customers globally. With a broad product portfolio spanning 12 different offerings, Tech4All enables customers to solve for business use cases and achieve 
operatonal efficiency and process optimization. In this project, I analyze a sample dataset of a dataset containing sales data for Tech4All to identify trends in sales, top performing products and regions, and customers. 
Based on these insights, I provide recommendations on where Tech4All can focus future efforts to optimize revenue growth and grow its business.
I use a combination of SQL queries to analyze the data and Tableau to visualize the trends I discovered.

# About the Data
The dataset contains two tables: one containing information about Tech4All's sales and order across their global regions and the second table containing information about the customers that the orders have been sold to. 
The dataset contains about 10,000 rows.
