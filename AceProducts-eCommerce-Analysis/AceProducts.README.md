# Portfolio Project - AceProducts eCommerce Analysis
Incorporated in 2018, AceProducts is an e-commerce company that provides popular electronic products to global customers. In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset investigating trends in sales, average order value, products, and operational effectiveness to provide insights on AceProducts's performance across many different areas of the business. I also analyzed the performance of AceProduct's loyalty program. I provide recommendations based on these insights on where AceProducts should focus efforts to improve growth.

I used a combination of conditional formatting, aggregation functions, Pivot Tables, and statistical analysis to clean, analyze, and summarize these insights to deliver to the finance, marketing, product and operations teams.

# About the Data
The dataset provides sales and order data for AceProducts's product portfolio globally. The raw dataset consists of about 108,000 rows:
* Steps taken to clean and prep the dataset for analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/aylee428/portfolio-projects/blob/main/AceProducts-eCommerce-Analysis/Cleaning%20documentation.pdf).
* Workbook for analysis and more detailed insights can be found [here](https://github.com/aylee428/portfolio-projects/blob/main/AceProducts-eCommerce-Analysis/AceProducts%20Analysis.xlsx).

# Summary of Insights
AceProducts Sales **has been declining from previous years with 2022 sales and order count decreasing by 44% and 38%** respectively from 2021. **27in 4K Gaming Monitor** consistently has been the company's best-selling product (based on revenue), accounting for **over 30% of total product sales each year**, while **Bose Soundsport Headphones** has been the lowest, accounting for **less than 1% of total product sales each year**. We are seeing customers in the loyalty program **generating more sales** for AceProduct ($500K more in 2021) and **spending more per order on average** ($35 more in 2022) compared to those not in the loyalty program, suggesting that the loyalty program is **trending positively and proving popular amongst our customers**. 

The products that have **taken the longest to deliver** have been **Macbook Air Laptops, Apple iPhones and Samsung Charging Cable Packs**, averaging 8 days compared to 7 days for all other products. While we continue to see strong ROI from **marketing directly** to consumers, our **email marketing channel** has been increasingly contributing more towards total sales, growing by **nearly 50% in 2022 since 2019**. **Over 96% of total sales in 2022** were made on our website compared to our mobile app (4%).

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:
* **Products:**
    * AceProducts should consider **making cuts to the Bose Soundsport Headphones product line**. This product line has contributed **less than 1% of total sales** each year and has not shown any positive growth in either number of orders or sales. If we need to consider further aggressive cuts to product lines, Apple iPhone and the Samsung Charging Cable Packs should be next as these products contributed **less than 3% of sales** each year and took the longest to deliver to customers on average, which impacts customers' perception of our service negatively.
* **Loyalty Program:**
    * The team recommends **continuing with the loyalty program** as customers in the loyalty program have shown to make more purchases on average and contribute to higher sales.
 * **Operational Effectiveness:**
     * As AceProducts continues to grow globally, consider **assessing whether there are better national delivery partners** we can work with. While our shipping times are on par with our largest eCommerce competitors, customers on average are increasingly expecting [faster delivery times](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/24/trending-now-last-mile-delivery-expectations-for-2023/?sh=685af0605e8d). There can be **improvements made to our delivery network** to align with growing consumer expectations.
* **Marketing Channels:**
    * The team recommends **continuing to make investments into the direct and email marketing channels**. These continue to provide strong growth and contributions to sales. Consider **decreasing marketing efforts on social media channels** as sales attributed to these channels have accounted for less than 2% of total sales traditionally and declining even further in recent years.
* **Platform Improvements:**
    * Our website continues to see strong demand for new accounts. We recommend **enhancements to continue to be made to our website and mobile apps** as both platforms continue to see strong growth.
